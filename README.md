Further Implementations:

1. Sandboxing: Run the code in a sandboxed environment to limit its access to the system. This can be achieved with Docker containers or dedicated virtual machines.
2. Resource Limits: Implement limits on CPU time and memory usage to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
3. Input Sanitization: Although difficult with direct code execution, ensure that inputs are checked or sanitized as much as possible.
4. Monitoring and Logging: Keep detailed logs and monitor the execution of submitted scripts for any unusual activity.
